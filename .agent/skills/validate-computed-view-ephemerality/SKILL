name: validate_computed_view_ephemerality
description: |
  Check that computed views (like latency, share, volatility) are not
  persisted in data structures or schema artifacts. Only raw observations
  are permitted. This validator inspects file contents and rejects any
  persistence or reuse of ephemeral metrics.

# Validate Computed View Ephemerality

## Input
- File or directory path containing artifacts
- Optionally a list of candidate view names

## Rules
- Files must not contain computed field names such as:
  - `latency`
  - `volatility`
  - `share_of_voice`
  - `efficiency_ratio`
  - any suffix indicating computed/store

## Failure Handling
- Any presence of patterns matching computed fields → reject

## Output
- `"EPHEMERAL_OK"` or `"EPHEMERAL_VIOLATION"` + details

## Scripts
The following script supports pattern checking:
